# Fake_News_Analysis

False information on the Internet has caused many social problems due to the raise of social network and its role in
different domains such as politics. In this Project, we are going to predict if a specific reddit post is fake news or not,
by looking at its title. Fake news and hoaxes have been there since before the advent of the Internet. The widely
accepted definition of Internet fake news is: fictitious articles deliberately fabricated to deceive readers. Social
media and news outlets publish fake news to increase readership or as part of psychological warfare. In general, the
goal is profiting through clickbaits. Clickbaits lure users and entice curiosity with flashy headlines or designs to
click links to increase advertisements revenues. This project analyzes the prevalence of fake news in light of the
advances in communication made possible by the emergence of social networking sites. The purpose of the work
is to come up with a solution that can be utilized by users to detect and filter out sites and links containing false
and misleading information. We use simple and carefully selected features such as the title and post to accurately
identify fake posts.
